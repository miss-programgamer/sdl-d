        You do not need to call this for built-in functionality of SDL; recording
        from a microphone or reading images from a camera, using standard SDL APIs,
        will manage permission requests for you.
        
        This function never blocks. Instead, the app-supplied callback will be
        called when a decision has been made. This callback may happen on a
        different thread, and possibly much later, as it might wait on a user to
        respond to a system dialog. If permission has already been granted for a
        specific entitlement, the callback will still fire, probably on the current
        thread and before this function returns.
        
        If the request submission fails, this function returns -1 and the callback
        will NOT be called, but this should only happen in catastrophic conditions,
        like memory running out. Normally there will be a yes or no to the request
        through the callback.
        
        For the `permission` parameter, choose a value from here:
        
        https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission
        
        Params:
            permission =    The permission to request.
            cb =            The callback to trigger when the request has a response.
            userdata =      An app-controlled pointer that is passed to the callback.
        
        Returns:
            true if the request was submitted, false if there was an error
            submitting. The result of the request is only ever reported
            through the callback, not this return value.
