/**
    Initializes and launches an SDL application, by doing platform-specific
    initialization before calling your mainFunction and cleanups after it
    returns, if that is needed for a specific platform, otherwise it just calls
    mainFunction.

    You can use this if you want to use your own `main` implementation without
    using SDL_main (like when using `SDL_MAIN_HANDLED`). When using this, you do
    *not* need `SDL_SetMainReady`.

    Params:
        argc = The argc parameter from the application's `main` function, or `0` if the platform's main-equivalent has no `argc`.
        argv = The argv parameter from the application's `main` function, or `null` if the platform's main-equivalent has no `argv`.
        mainFunction = Your SDL app's C-style `main`.
        reserved = Should be `null` (reserved for future use, will probably be platform-specific then).

    Returns:
        The return value from `mainFunction`: `0` on success, otherwise failure;
        `SDL_GetError` might have more information on the failure.

    An entry point for SDL's use in `SDL_MAIN_USE_CALLBACKS`.

    Generally, you should not call this function directly. This only exists to
    hand off work into SDL as soon as possible, where it has a lot more control
    and functionality available, and make the inline code in SDL_main.h as
    small as possible.

    Not all platforms use this, its actual use is hidden in a magic
    header-only library, and you should not call this directly unless you
    _really_ know what you're doing.

    Params:
        argc = Standard Unix main argc.

    Returns:

        paired with a call to $(D SDL_UnregisterApp), but a second registration
        attempt while a previous registration is still active will be ignored,

        Most applications do not need to, and should not, call this directly;
        SDL will call it when initializing the video subsystem.

        Params:
            name = The window class name, in UTF-8 encoding. If `null`, SDL currently uses "SDL_app" but this isn't guaranteed.
            style = The value to use in WNDCLASSEX::style. If `name` is `null`, SDL currently uses `(CS_BYTEALIGNCLIENT | CS_OWNDC)` regardless of what is specified here.
            hInst = The `HINSTANCE` to use in WNDCLASSEX::hInstance. If zero, SDL will use `GetModuleHandle(null)` instead.

        Returns:
            `true` on success or `false` on failure; call $(D SDL_GetError) for more information.
