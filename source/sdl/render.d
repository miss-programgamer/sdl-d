      for floating point textures, `SDL_COLORSPACE_HDR10` for 10-bit textures,
      `SDL_COLORSPACE_SRGB` for other RGB textures and `SDL_COLORSPACE_JPEG` for
      YUV textures.
    - `SDL_PROP_TEXTURE_CREATE_FORMAT_NUMBER`: one of the enumerated values in
      `SDL_PixelFormat`, defaults to the best RGBA format for the renderer
    - `SDL_PROP_TEXTURE_CREATE_ACCESS_NUMBER`: one of the enumerated values in

    - `SDL_PROP_TEXTURE_CREATE_WIDTH_NUMBER`: the width of the texture in

    single coordinate system.

    will be handled using the appropriate quality hints. For best results use
    integer scaling factors.

/**
    Update the screen with any rendering performed since the previous call.

    SDL's rendering functions operate on a backbuffer; that is, calling a
    rendering function such as $(D SDL_RenderLine) does not directly put a line
    on the screen, but rather updates the backbuffer. As such, you compose your
    entire scene and *present* the composed backbuffer to the screen as a
    complete picture.

    Therefore, when using SDL's rendering API, one does all drawing intended
    for the frame, and then calls this function once per frame to present the
    final drawing to the user.

    The backbuffer should be considered invalidated after each present; do not
    assume that previous contents will exist between frames. You are strongly
    encouraged to call $(D SDL_RenderClear) to initialize the backbuffer before
    starting each new frame's drawing, even if you plan to overwrite every
    pixel.

    Please note, that in case of rendering to a texture - there is **no need**
    to call $(D SDL_RenderPresent) after drawing needed objects to a texture,
    and should not be done; you are only required to change back the rendering
    target to default via `SDL_SetRenderTarget(renderer, null)` afterwards, as
    textures by themselves do not have a concept of backbuffers. Calling
    $(D SDL_RenderPresent) while rendering to a texture will still update the
    screen with any current drawing that has been done _to the window itself_.

    Params:
        renderer = The rendering context.

        `true` on success or `false` on failure; call $(D SDL_GetError) for more information.

    Force the rendering context to flush any pending commands and state.

    You do not need to (and in fact, shouldn't) call this function unless you
    are planning to call into OpenGL/Direct3D/Metal/whatever directly, in
    addition to using an $(D SDL_Renderer).

    This is for a very-specific case: if you are using SDL's render API, and
    you plan to make OpenGL/D3D/whatever calls in addition to SDL render API
    calls. If this applies, you should call this function between calls to
    SDL's render API and the low-level API you're using in cooperation.

    In all other cases, you can ignore this function.

    This call makes SDL flush any pending rendering work it was queueing up to
    do later in a single batch, and marks any internal cached state as invalid,
    so it'll prepare all its state again later, from scratch.

    This means you do not need to save state in your rendering code to protect
    the $(D SDL_Renderer). However, there lots of arbitrary pieces of Direct3D
    and OpenGL state that can confuse things; you should use your best judgment
    and be prepared to make changes if specific state needs to be protected.

    This function will render a string of text to an $(D SDL_Renderer). Note

    and not intended to be used for production apps and games.

    Among these limitations:

    - It accepts UTF-8 strings, but will only renders ASCII characters.
    - It has a single, tiny size (8x8 pixels). One can use logical presentation
      or scaling to adjust it, but it will be blurry.
    - It uses a simple, hardcoded bitmap font. It does not allow different font
      selections and it does not support truetype, for proper scaling.
    - It does no word-wrapping and does not treat newline characters as a line
      break. If the text goes out of the window, it's gone.

    For serious text rendering, there are several good options, such as
    SDL_ttf, stb_truetype, or other external libraries.
