/**
    Initialize the SDL library.

    SDL_Init() simply forwards to calling SDL_InitSubSystem(). Therefore, the
    two may be used interchangeably. Though for readability of your code
    SDL_InitSubSystem() might be preferred.

    The file I/O (for example: SDL_IOFromFile) and threading (SDL_CreateThread)
    subsystems are initialized by default. Message boxes
    (SDL_ShowSimpleMessageBox) also attempt to work without initializing the
    video subsystem, in hopes of being useful in showing an error dialog when
    SDL_Init fails. You must specifically initialize other subsystems if you
    use them in your application.

    Logging (such as SDL_Log) works without initialization, too.

    `flags` may be any of the following OR'd together:

    -   `SDL_INIT_AUDIO`: audio subsystem; automatically initializes the events
        subsystem
    -   `SDL_INIT_VIDEO`: video subsystem; automatically initializes the events
        subsystem, should be initialized on the main thread.
    -   `SDL_INIT_JOYSTICK`: joystick subsystem; automatically initializes the
        events subsystem
    -   `SDL_INIT_HAPTIC`: haptic (force feedback) subsystem
    -   `SDL_INIT_GAMEPAD`: gamepad subsystem; automatically initializes the
        joystick subsystem
    -   `SDL_INIT_EVENTS`: events subsystem
    -   `SDL_INIT_SENSOR`: sensor subsystem; automatically initializes the events
        subsystem
    -   `SDL_INIT_CAMERA`: camera subsystem; automatically initializes the events
        subsystem

    Subsystem initialization is ref-counted, you must call SDL_QuitSubSystem()
    for each SDL_InitSubSystem() to correctly shutdown a subsystem manually (or
    call SDL_Quit() to force shutdown). If a subsystem is already loaded then
    this call will increase the ref-count and return.

    Consider reporting some basic metadata about your application before
    calling SDL_Init, using either SDL_SetAppMetadata() or
    SDL_SetAppMetadataProperty().

    Params:
        flags = subsystem initialization flags.

    -   `SDL_PROP_APP_METADATA_NAME_STRING`: The human-readable name of the
        application, like "My Game 2: Bad Guy's Revenge!". This will show up
        anywhere the OS shows the name of the application separately from window
        titles, such as volume control applets, etc. This defaults to "SDL
        Application".
    -   `SDL_PROP_APP_METADATA_VERSION_STRING`: The version of the app that is
        running; there are no rules on format, so "1.0.3beta2" and "April 22nd,
        2024" and a git hash are all valid options. This has no default.
    -   `SDL_PROP_APP_METADATA_IDENTIFIER_STRING`: A unique string that
        identifies this app. This must be in reverse-domain format, like
        "com.example.mygame2". This string is used by desktop compositors to
        identify and group windows together, as well as match applications with
        associated desktop settings and icons. If you plan to package your
        application in a container such as Flatpak, the app ID should match the
        name of your Flatpak container as well. This has no default.
    -   `SDL_PROP_APP_METADATA_CREATOR_STRING`: The human-readable name of the
        creator/developer/maker of this app, like "MojoWorkshop, LLC"
    -   `SDL_PROP_APP_METADATA_COPYRIGHT_STRING`: The human-readable copyright
        notice, like "Copyright (c) 2024 MojoWorkshop, LLC" or whatnot. Keep this
        to one line, don't paste a copy of a whole software license in here. This
        has no default.
    -   `SDL_PROP_APP_METADATA_URL_STRING`: A URL to the app on the web. Maybe a
        product page, or a storefront, or even a GitHub repository, for user's
        further information This has no default.
    -   `SDL_PROP_APP_METADATA_TYPE_STRING`: The type of application this is.
        Currently this string can be "game" for a video game, "mediaplayer" for a
        media player, or generically "application" if nothing else applies.
        Future versions of SDL might add new types. This defaults to
